This diagram illustrates the process of creating a new note by entering text into the designated field and selecting the Save option. Upon activation, the JavaScript script triggers an event handler to dispatch a POST request to the server for note creation. Subsequently, the server replies with a status code that is captured by the JavaScript script to refresh the page with the newly added note.
