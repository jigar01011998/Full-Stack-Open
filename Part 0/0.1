HTML, also known as HyperText Markup Language, acts as the foundation of web pages, enabling users to organize content through elements enclosed within tags. Each element consists of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag, with attributes offering additional functionality. Properly nesting elements is essential for maintaining coherence. HTML documents contain key elements such as <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, <meta>, <title>, and <body>, structuring content and providing important details like character encoding and page titles. Images are inserted using the <img> element, while text is formatted using elements like headings (<h1> to <h6>), paragraphs (<p>), and lists (<ul>, <ol>, <li>). Links are established with the <a> element, utilizing the href attribute to specify the URL being linked. Mastering these fundamentals establishes a solid groundwork for web development, promoting further exploration and hands-on experience.
